## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not distributing points** - Check after every level up!
2. **Ignoring talents** - They provide huge combat bonuses
3. **Buying wrong gear** - Mages need magic-focused items
4. **Fighting bosses unprepared** - Level up and gear up first
5. **Forgetting to rest** - Free full HP restore
6. **Not buying potions** - They save your life

## Advanced Tips

### Talent Synergies
- Warrior: Power Strike + Berserker Rage = Huge damage when low HP
- Mage: Arcane Knowledge + Arcane Missiles = Maximum magic damage
- Rogue: Precision + Backstab = One-shot potential
- Cleric: All healing talents + Prayer of Mending = Near-immortal
- Ranger: Marksmanship + Multi-Shot = Area damage

### Attribute Stacking
- Going all-in on one stat is viable
- Hybrid builds work but are less powerful
- Defense is valuable for all classes
- Speed helps with critical strikes (Rogue)

### Economy Optimization
- Human origin = +10% gold (adds up over time)
- Don't sell items (no sell mechanic yet)
- Do all available quests for bonus gold
- Boss fights give the most gold
